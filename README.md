# air-quality-app

#### Description: A web app to show weather and air pollution levels at the user's location and searched locations using data from multiple APIs <br /> <br />

### _Must include:_

#### -requests to multiple APIs to collect and display pollution and weather data to the user (if no data is available, state this)

#### -automatically works with the user's coordinates by prompting them to share their location AND allows them to search by a city name to check a different location

#### -visuals that show the weather and pollution levels through pictures or icons

#### -data for air pollution using the primary pollutant measurement in their area (NOTE: this is usually pm2.5 particulate pollution) and a scale to show how dangerous the current primary pollutant level is

#### -all work will be done using webpack (or react) <br /> <br />

### _Would be nice to include:_

#### -the ability for users to check historical data using a calendar or get a prediction on weather and predicted pollution levels for the near future (1 week)

#### -give recommendations to the user about how to protect themselves from air pollution when it is detected that their location has high levels (over a threshold)

#### -showing the other non-primary pollutants' levels (could include SO2, NO2, and CO) with information about how high the current levels are

#### -a visual that that adapts to the level of particles in the air and allows users to visualize their air using points or CSS magic <br /> <br />

### Ben will work on:

#### -mainly on the JS parts to work with the API(s) to gain the necessary data

### Alex will work on:

#### -mainly on the UI part to gain input and show the output to the user

### _Expected deadline to finish project:_
